# Teste Juros Compostos

## This challenge was proposed by Thiago Medeiros course.

The biggest challenge of this project was to implement a second js file, to separate responsibilities of the files. I learned how to share variables with 'export' and 'import', and this part of to implementing a second file was not the project's objective, but it was a great learning.
